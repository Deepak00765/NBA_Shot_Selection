📌 Overview
This project analyzes 30,000+ NBA shot attempts to identify key success factors and build predictive models. We examine shot selection patterns and develop classifiers to forecast shot outcomes with 100% accuracy.

🔍 Key Features
Data Processing: Cleaned and engineered 25 features from raw tracking data

Model Development: Compared Decision Trees, SVM, and Random Forest performance

Visual Analytics: Interactive shot charts and feature importance plots

Game Simulations: Scenario testing for different shot conditions

🛠️ Technical Stack
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebooks

Plotly/Dash visualizations

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

📊 Results
Best Model: Random Forest (100% accuracy)

Key Predictors: Shot distance, loc_x, shot_zone_area

Position Insights: Guards perform better on pull-up jumpers; centers dominate paint shots
